<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AutoGen has received tremendous interest and recognition.</strong></li>
<li><strong>AutoGen has many exciting new features and ongoing research.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Five months have passed since the initial spinoff of AutoGen from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FLAML</a>. What have we learned since then? What are the milestones achieved? What's next?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h2>
<p>AutoGen was motivated by two big questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are future AI applications like?</li>
<li>How do we empower every developer to build them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year, I worked with my colleagues and collaborators from Penn State University and University of Washington, on a new multi-agent framework, to enable the next generation of applications powered by large language models.
We have been building AutoGen, as a programming framework for agentic AI, just like PyTorch for deep learning.
We developed AutoGen in an open source project <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FLAML</a>: a fast library for AutoML and tuning. After a few studies like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EcoOptiGen</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathChat</a>, in August, we published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical report</a> about the multi-agent framework.
In October, we moved AutoGen from FLAML to a standalone repo on GitHub, and published an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated technical report</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="feedback">Feedback<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update#feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Feedback" title="Direct link to Feedback">​</a></h2>
<p>Since then, we've got new feedback every day, everywhere. Users have shown really high recognition of the new levels of capability enabled by AutoGen. For example, there are many comments like the following on X (Twitter) or YouTube.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Autogen gave me the same a-ha moment that I haven't felt since trying out GPT-3
for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have never been this surprised since ChatGPT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many users have deep understanding of the value in different dimensions, such as the modularity, flexibility and simplicity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same reason autogen is significant is the same reason OOP is a good idea. Autogen packages up all that complexity into an agent I can create in one line, or modify with another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over time, more and more users share their experiences in using or contributing to autogen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our Data Science department Autogen is helping us develop a production ready
multi-agents framework.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I built an interactive learning tool for students, I looked for a tool that
could streamline the logistics but also give enough flexibility so I could use
customized tools. AutoGen has both. It simplified the work. Thanks to Chi and his
team for sharing such a wonderful tool with the community.</p>

<p>Exciting news: the latest AutoGen release now features my contribution…
This experience has been a wonderful blend of learning and contributing,
demonstrating the dynamic and collaborative spirit of the tech community.</p>

<p>With the support of a grant through the Data Intensive Studies Center at Tufts
University, our group is hoping to solve some of the challenges students face when
transitioning from undergraduate to graduate-level courses, particularly in Tufts'
Doctor of Physical Therapy program in the School of Medicine. We're experimenting
with Autogen to create tailored assessments, individualized study guides, and focused
tutoring. This approach has led to significantly better results than those we
achieved using standard chatbots. With the help of Chi and his group at Microsoft,
our current experiments include using multiple agents in sequential chat, teachable
agents, and round-robin style debate formats. These methods have proven more
effective in generating assessments and feedback compared to other large language
models (LLMs) we've explored. I've also used OpenAI Assistant agents through Autogen
in my Primary Care class to facilitate student engagement in patient interviews
through digital simulations. The agent retrieved information from a real patient
featured in a published case study, allowing students to practice their interview
skills with realistic information.</p>

<p>These are just a small fraction of examples. We have seen big enterprise customers’ interest from pretty much every vertical industry: Accounting, Airlines, Biotech, Consulting, Consumer Packaged Goods, Electronics, Entertainment, Finance, Fintech, Government, Healthcare, Manufacturer, Metals, Pharmacy, Research, Retailer, Social Media, Software, Supply Chain, Technology, Telecom…</p>
<p>AutoGen is used or contributed by companies, organizations, universities from A to Z, in all over the world. We have seen hundreds of example applications. Some organization uses AutoGen as the backbone to build their agent platform. Others use AutoGen for diverse scenarios, including research and investment to novel and creative applications of multiple agents.</p>

</ul>
<p>I am so amazed by their creativity and passion.
I also appreciate the recognition and awards AutoGen has received, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selected by <a href="https://thesequence.substack.com/p/my-five-favorite-ai-papers-of-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheSequence: My Five Favorite AI Papers of 2023</a></li>

</ul>
<p>On March 1, the initial AutoGen multi-agent experiment on the challenging <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAIA</a> benchmark turned out to achieve the No. 1 accuracy with a big leap, in all the three levels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="gaia" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/gaia-be5cf1e2098456a9f67814d0b9681777.png" width="3604" height="1585" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>That shows the big potential of using AutoGen in solving complex tasks.
And it's just the beginning of the community's effort to answering a few hard open questions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-questions">Open Questions<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update#open-questions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open Questions" title="Direct link to Open Questions">​</a></h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoGen technical report</a>, we laid out a number of challenging research questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to design optimal multi-agent workflows?</li>
<li>How to create highly capable agents?</li>
<li>How to enable scale, safety and human agency?</li>
</ol>
<p>The community has been working hard to address them in several dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation. Convenient and insightful evaluation is the foundation of making solid progress.</li>
<li>Interface. An intuitive, expressive and standardized interface is the prerequisite of fast experimentation and optimization.</li>
<li>Optimization. Both the multi-agent interaction design (e.g., decomposition) and the individual agent capability need to be optimized to satisfy specific application needs.</li>
<li>Integration. Integration with new technologies is an effective way to enhance agent capability.</li>
<li>Learning/Teaching. Agentic learning and teaching are intuitive approaches for agents to optimize their performance, enable human agency and enhance safety.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-features--ongoing-research">New Features &amp; Ongoing Research<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update#new-features--ongoing-research" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Features &amp; Ongoing Research" title="Direct link to New Features &amp; Ongoing Research">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evaluation">Evaluation<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update#evaluation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evaluation" title="Direct link to Evaluation">​</a></h3>
<p>We are working on agent-based evaluation tools and benchmarking tools. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/20/AgentEval">AgentEval</a>. Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> finds that LLM agents built with AutoGen can be used to automatically identify evaluation criteria and assess the performance from task descriptions and execution logs. It is demonstrated as a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agenteval_cq_math.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notebook example</a>. Feedback and help are welcome for building it into the library.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/25/AutoGenBench">AutoGenBench</a>. AutoGenBench is a commandline tool for downloading, configuring, running an agentic benchmark, and reporting results. It is designed to allow repetition, isolation and instrumentation, leveraging the new <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchat_logging">runtime logging</a> feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools have been used for improving the AutoGen library as well as applications. For example, the new state-of-the-art performance achieved by a multi-agent solution to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAIA</a> benchmark has benefited from these evaluation tools.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interface">Interface<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update#interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Interface" title="Direct link to Interface">​</a></h3>
<p>We are making rapid progress in further improving the interface to make it even easier to build agent applications. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/26/Agent-AutoBuild">AutoBuild</a>. AutoBuild is an ongoing area of research to automatically create or select a group of agents for a given task and objective. If successful, it will greatly reduce the effort from users or developers when using the multi-agent technology. It also paves the way for agentic decomposition to handle complex tasks. It is available as an experimental feature and demonstrated in two modes: free-form <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/autobuild_basic.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/autobuild_agent_library.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selection</a> from a library.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenStudio">AutoGen Studio</a>. AutoGen Studio is a no-code UI for fast experimentation with the multi-agent conversations. It lowers the barrier of entrance to the AutoGen technology. Models, agents, and workflows can all be configured without writing code. And chatting with multiple agents in a playground is immediately available after the configuration. Although only a subset of <code>pyautogen</code> features are available in this sample app, it demonstrates a promising experience. It has generated tremendous excitement in the community.</li>
<li>Conversation Programming+. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoGen paper</a> introduced a key concept of <em>Conversation Programming</em>, which can be used to program diverse conversation patterns such as 1-1 chat, group chat, hierarchical chat, nested chat etc. While we offered dynamic group chat as an example of high-level orchestration, it made other patterns relatively less discoverable. Therefore, we have added more convenient conversation programming features which enables easier definition of other types of complex workflow, such as <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/02/11/FSM-GroupChat">finite state machine based group chat</a>, <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchats_sequential_chats">sequential chats</a>, and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchat_nestedchat">nested chats</a>. Many users have found them useful in implementing specific patterns, which have been always possible but more obvious with the added features. I will write another blog post for a deep dive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learningoptimizationteaching">Learning/Optimization/Teaching<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update#learningoptimizationteaching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Learning/Optimization/Teaching" title="Direct link to Learning/Optimization/Teaching">​</a></h3>
<p>The features in this category allow agents to remember teachings from users or other agents long term, or improve over iterations. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/23/AgentOptimizer">AgentOptimizer</a>. This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> finds an approach of training LLM agents without modifying the model. As a case study, this technique optimizes a set of Python functions for agents to use in solving a set of training tasks. It is planned to be available as an experimental feature.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/09/EcoAssistant">EcoAssistant</a>. This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> finds a multi-agent teaching approach when using agents with different capacities powered by different LLMs. For example, a GPT-4 agent can teach a GPT-3.5 agent by demonstration. With this approach, one only needs 1/3 or 1/2 of GPT-4's cost, while getting 10-20% higher success rate than GPT-4 on coding-based QA. No finetuning is needed. All you need is a GPT-4 endpoint and a GPT-3.5-turbo endpoint. Help is appreciated to offer this technique as a feature in the AutoGen library.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/10/26/TeachableAgent">Teachability</a>. Every LLM agent in AutoGen can be made teachable, i.e., remember facts, preferences, skills etc. from interacting with other agents. For example, a user behind a user proxy agent can teach an assistant agent instructions in solving a difficult math problem. After teaching once, the problem solving rate for the assistant agent can have a dramatic improvement (e.g., 37% -&gt; 95% for gpt-4-0613).

This feature works for GPTAssistantAgent (using OpenAI's assistant API) and group chat as well. One interesting use case of teachability + FSM group chat: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/combatting-ai-naivete-teaching-resilience-emotional-leah-bonser-jdhrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teaching resilience</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integration">Integration<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update#integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integration" title="Direct link to Integration">​</a></h3>
<p>The extensible design of AutoGen makes it easy to integrate with new technologies. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/26/Custom-Models">Custom models and clients</a> can be used as backends of an agent, such as Huggingface models and inference APIs.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/13/OAI-assistants">OpenAI assistant</a> can be used as the backend of an agent (GPTAssistantAgent). It will be nice to reimplement it as a custom client to increase the compatibility with ConversableAgent.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/06/LMM-Agent">Multimodality</a>. LMM models like GPT-4V can be used to provide vision to an agent, and accomplish interesting multimodal tasks by conversing with other agents, including advanced image analysis, figure generation, and automatic iterative improvement in image generation.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="multimodal" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/dalle_gpt4v-627805c9f25aa886377ac86216900e4a.png" width="3146" height="2014" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The above only covers a subset of new features and roadmap. There are many other interesting new features, integration examples or sample apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>new features like stateful code execution, <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#tool-calling">tool decorators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_capability_long_context_handling.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long context handling</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_surfer.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web agents</a>.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>: Introduce Stateflow, a task-solving paradigm that conceptualizes complex task-solving processes backed by LLMs as state machines.
Introduce how to use GroupChat to realize such an idea with a customized speaker selection function.</p>
<p>The paper is coming soon!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/02/29/StateFlow#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>LLMs have increasingly been employed to solve complex, multi-step tasks, e.g., tasks that require a sequence of complex reasoning
and interacting with external environments and tools. To facilitate the development of such applications, we introduce <strong>StateFlow</strong>, a new paradigm
that conceptualizes complex task-solving processes backed by LLMs as state machines. With proper construction of states and definition of
state transitions, we can ground the progress of task-solving, ensuring clear tracking and management of LLMs' responses throughout the task-solving process.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stateflow">StateFlow<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/02/29/StateFlow#stateflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to StateFlow" title="Direct link to StateFlow">​</a></h2>
<p>Finite State machines (FSMs) are used as control systems to monitor practical applications, such as traffic light control.
A defined state machine is a model of behavior that decides what to do based on current status. A state represents one situation that the state machine might be in, and all states cover all possible situations of the FSM.
Drawing from this concept, we want to use state machines to model the task-solving process of LLMs. When using an LLM to solve a task, each step of the task-solving process can be mapped to a state.
For example, the process starts at the <em>Init</em> state when the task is given. When reaching a state, a sequence of output functions is called to add content to the context history, including sending a specific instruction, using a tool, or calling the LLM itself.
Based on the current state and context history, the <strong>StateFlow</strong> model determines the next state to transit to. The task-solving process progresses by transitioning through different states and performing corresponding actions and ends until a final state is reached.
Essentially, we are sending different instructions to an LLM to ask it to perform different actions based on its current status.</p>
<p>In <strong>StateFlow</strong>, we construct a state machine to control a single LLM, sending different instructions to it at different states.
We also provide an agent view of our framework, <strong>SF_Agent</strong>, that can use different LLM agents to perform actions at different states.
In this case, we don't need to add instructions to the context history and call the LLM. Instead, we construct individual agents with pre-set instructions and (potentially) different LLMs.
AutoGen is the perfect platform to implement <strong>SF_Agent</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experiments">Experiments<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/02/29/StateFlow#experiments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Experiments" title="Direct link to Experiments">​</a></h2>
<p>We evaluate <strong>StateFlow</strong> on the SQL task and Bash task from the InterCode benchmark, with both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4.
We construct different <strong>StateFlow</strong> models for each task (See the figure below). But note that most of the states are shared between the two tasks.
Within each state, we define a sequence of actions to be performed. The most common action sequence is P-&gt;M-&gt;E, meaning we first send a prompt, then call the LLM to generate a response, and finally execute commands from the response.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Intercode Example" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/intercode-519533781527d1fcca99dd8b5b0d90b2.png" width="1424" height="874" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We record different metrics for a comprehensive comparison. The 'SR' (success rate) and 'rewards' measure the performance,
'Turns represents a number of interactions with the environment, and 'Error Rate' represents the percentage of errors of the commands executed.
We also record the cost and token counts to show the LLM usage.</p>
<p>We compare with the following baselines:
(1) ReAct: a few-shot prompting method that prompts the model to generate thoughts and actions.
(2) Plan &amp; Solve: A two-step prompting strategy to first ask the model to propose a plan and then execute it.</p>
<p>We show the results of the Bash task in the figure below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Bash Result" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/bash_result-f93ebfe76d6d837e614ae1a3ebc06274.png" width="1430" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Our evaluation demonstrates the advantages of <strong>StateFlow</strong> and <strong>SF_Agent</strong> over existing methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
For example, in the Bash task with GPT-4, <strong>SF_Agent</strong> improves the success rate by 8% and has 4x less cost compared to ReAct prompting.</p>

<p>We illustrate how to build <strong>StateFlow</strong> with GroupChat. Previous blog <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/02/11/FSM-GroupChat/">FSM Group Chat</a>
introduces a new feature of GroupChat that allows us to input a transition graph to constrain agent transitions.
It requires us to use natural language to describe the transition conditions of the FSM in the agent's <code>description</code> parameter, and then use an LLM to take in the description and make decisions of the next agent.
In this blog, we take advantages of a customized speaker selection function passed to the <code>speaker_selection_method</code> of the <code>GroupChat</code> object.
This function allows us to custom the transition logic between agents, and can be used together with the transition graph introduced in FSM Group Chat. The current StateFlow implementation also allows the user to override the transition graph.
These transitions can be based on the current speaker and static checking of the context history (for example, checking if 'Error' is in the last message).</p>
<p>We present an example of how to build a state-oriented workflow using GroupChat.
We define a custom speaker selection function to be passed into the <code>speaker_selection_method</code> parameter of the GroupChat.
Here, the task is to retrieve research papers related to a given topic, and create a markdown table for these papers.</p>

<p>We define the following agents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializer: Start the workflow by sending a task.</li>
<li>Coder: Retrieve papers from the internet by writing code.</li>
<li>Executor: Execute the code.</li>
<li>Scientist: Read the papers and write a summary.</li>

<p>In the Figure, we define a simple workflow for research with 4 states: Init, Retrieve, Reserach and End. Within each state, we will call different agents to perform the tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Init: We use the initializer to start the workflow.</li>
<li>Retrieve: We will first call the coder to write code and then call the executor to execute the code.</li>
<li>Research: We will call the scientist to read the papers and write a summary.</li>
<li>End: We will end the workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we define a customized function to control the transition between states:</p>

<p>We recommend implementing the transition logic for each speaker in the customized function. In analogy to a state machine, a state transition function determines the next state based on the current state and input.
Instead of returning an <code>Agent</code> class representing the next speaker, we can also return a string from <code>['auto', 'manual', 'random', 'round_robin']</code> to select a default method to use.
For example, we can always default to the built-in <code>auto</code> method to employ a LLM-based group chat manager to select the next speaker.
When returning <code>None</code>, the group chat will terminate. Note that some of the transitions, such as "initializer" -&gt; "coder" can be defined with the transition graph.</p>

<p>Recently, FSM Group Chat is released that allows the user to input a transition graph to constrain agent transitions. This is useful as the number of agents increases because the number of transition pairs (N choose 2 combinations) increases exponentially increasing the risk of sub-optimal transitions, which leads to wastage of tokens and/or poor outcomes.</p>

<li>Decision tree flow, like a decision tree, we start with a root node (agent), and flow down the decision tree with agents being nodes. For example, if the query is a SQL query, hand over to the SQL agent, else if the query is a RAG query, hand over to the RAG agent.</li>
<li>Sequential Team Ops. Suppose we have a team of 3 developer agents, each responsible for a different GitHub repo. We also have a team of business analyst that discuss and debate the overall goal of the user. We could have the manager agent of the developer team speak to the manager agent of the business analysis team. That way, the discussions are more focused team-wise, and better outcomes can be expected.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that we are not enforcing a directed acyclic graph; the user can specify the graph to be acyclic, but cyclic workflows can also be useful to iteratively work on a problem, and layering additional analysis onto the solution.</p>

<p>We have added two parameters <code>allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions</code> and <code>speaker_transitions_type</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions</code>: is a dictionary with the type expectation of <code>{Agent: [Agent]}</code>. The key refers to the source agent, while the value(s) in the list refers to the target agent(s). If none, a fully connection graph is assumed.</li>
<li><code>speaker_transitions_type</code>: is a string with the type expectation of string, and specifically, one of ["allowed", "disallowed"]. We wanted the user to be able to supply a dictionary of allowed or disallowed transitions to improve the ease of use. In the code base, we would invert the disallowed transition into a allowed transition dictionary <code>allowed_speaker_transitions_dict</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick demonstration of how to initiate a FSM-based <code>GroupChat</code> in the <code>AutoGen</code> framework. In this demonstration, if we consider each agent as a state, and each agent speaks according to certain conditions. For example, User always initiates the task first, followed by Planner creating a plan. Then Engineer and Executor work alternately, with Critic intervening when necessary, and after Critic, only Planner should revise additional plans. Each state can only exist at a time, and there are transition conditions between states. Therefore, GroupChat can be well abstracted as a Finite-State Machine (FSM).</p>

<li>Here, I have configured the <code>system_messages</code> as "task" because every agent should know what it needs to do. In this example, each agent has the same task, which is to count in sequence.</li>
<li><strong>The most important point is the <code>description</code> parameter, where I have used natural language to describe the transition conditions of the FSM. Because the manager knows which agents are available next based on the constraints of the graph, I describe in the <code>description</code> field of each candidate agent when it can speak, effectively describing the transition conditions in the FSM.</strong></li>

<p align="center"><em>Anny is a Discord bot powered by AutoGen to help AutoGen's Discord server.</em></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/02/02/AutoAnny#tldr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TL;DR" title="Direct link to TL;DR">​</a></h2>
<p>We are adding a new sample app called Anny-- a simple Discord bot powered
by AutoGen that's intended to assist AutoGen Devs. See <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/auto-anny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>samples/apps/auto-anny</code></a> for details.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/02/02/AutoAnny#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Over the past few months, AutoGen has experienced large growth in number of users and number of community requests and feedback.
However, accommodating this demand and feedback requires manually sifting through issues, PRs, and discussions on GitHub, as well as managing messages
from AutoGen's 14000+ community members on Discord. There are many tasks that AutoGen's developer community has to perform everyday,
but here are some common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answering questions</li>
<li>Recognizing and prioritizing bugs and features</li>
<li>Maintaining responsiveness for our incredible community</li>
<li>Tracking growth</li>
</ul>
<p>This requires a significant amount of effort. Agentic-workflows and interfaces promise adding
immense value-added automation for many tasks, so we thought <em>why don't we use AutoGen to make
our lives easier?!</em> So we're turning to automation to help us and allow
us to focus on what's most critical.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-version-of-anny">Current Version of Anny<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/02/02/AutoAnny#current-version-of-anny" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Current Version of Anny" title="Direct link to Current Version of Anny">​</a></h2>
<p>The current version of Anny is pretty simple -- it uses the Discord API and AutoGen to enable a bot
that can respond to a set of commands.</p>
<p>For example, it supports commands like <code>/heyanny help</code> for command listing, <code>/heyanny ghstatus</code> for
GitHub activity summary, <code>/heyanny ghgrowth</code> for GitHub repo growth indicators, and <code>/heyanny ghunattended</code> for listing unattended issues and PRs. Most of these commands use multiple AutoGen agents to accomplish these task.</p>
<p>To use Anny, please follow instructions in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/auto-anny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>samples/apps/auto-anny</code></a>.</p>

<p>If you're an open-source developer managing your own project, you can probably relate to our challenges. We invite you to check out Anny and contribute to its development and roadmap.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/26/Custom-Models#tldr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TL;DR" title="Direct link to TL;DR">​</a></h2>
<p>AutoGen now supports custom models! This feature empowers users to define and load their own models, allowing for a more flexible and personalized inference mechanism. By adhering to a specific protocol, you can integrate your custom model for use with AutoGen and respond to prompts any way needed by using any model/API call/hardcoded response you want.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Depending on what model you use, you may need to play with the default prompts of the Agent's</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quickstart">Quickstart<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/26/Custom-Models#quickstart" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quickstart" title="Direct link to Quickstart">​</a></h2>
<p>An interactive and easy way to get started is by following the notebook <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_custom_model.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> which loads a local model from HuggingFace into AutoGen and uses it for inference, and making changes to the class provided.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-create-the-custom-model-client-class">Step 1: Create the custom model client class<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/26/Custom-Models#step-1-create-the-custom-model-client-class" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Create the custom model client class" title="Direct link to Step 1: Create the custom model client class">​</a></h3>
<p>To get started with using custom models in AutoGen, you need to create a model client class that adheres to the <code>ModelClient</code> protocol defined in <code>client.py</code>. The new model client class should implement these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>create()</code>: Returns a response object that implements the <code>ModelClientResponseProtocol</code> (more details in the Protocol section).</li>
<li><code>message_retrieval()</code>: Processes the response object and returns a list of strings or a list of message objects (more details in the Protocol section).</li>
<li><code>cost()</code>: Returns the cost of the response.</li>
<li><code>get_usage()</code>: Returns a dictionary with keys from <code>RESPONSE_USAGE_KEYS = ["prompt_tokens", "completion_tokens", "total_tokens", "cost", "model"]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. of a bare bones dummy custom class:</p>

<p>A custom model class can be created in many ways, but needs to adhere to the <code>ModelClient</code> protocol and response structure which is defined in <code>client.py</code> and shown below.</p>
<p>The response protocol is currently using the minimum required fields from the autogen codebase that match the OpenAI response structure. Any response protocol that matches the OpenAI response structure will probably be more resilient to future changes, but we are starting off with minimum requirements to make adpotion of this feature easier.</p>

<p>If something doesn't work then run through the checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have followed the client protocol and client response protocol when creating the custom model class<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><code>create()</code> method: <code>ModelClientResponseProtocol</code> must be followed when returning an inference response during <code>create</code> call.</li>
<li><code>message_retrieval()</code> method: returns a list of strings or a list of message objects. If a list of message objects is returned, they currently must contain the fields of OpenAI's ChatCompletion Message object, since that is expected for function or tool calling in the rest of the codebase at the moment, unless a custom agent is being used.</li>
<li><code>cost()</code>method: returns an integer, and if you don't care about cost tracking you can just return <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><code>get_usage()</code>: returns a dictionary, and if you don't care about usage tracking you can just return an empty dictionary <code>{}</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure you have a corresponding entry in the <code>OAI_CONFIG_LIST</code> and that that entry has the <code>"model_client_cls":"&lt;custom-model-class-name&gt;"</code> field.</li>
<li>Make sure you have registered the client using the corresponding config entry and your new class <code>agent.register_model_client(model_client_cls=&lt;class-of-custom-model&gt;, [other optional args])</code></li>
<li>Make sure that all of the custom models defined in the <code>OAI_CONFIG_LIST</code> have been registered.</li>
<li>Any other troubleshooting might need to be done in the custom code itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Measurement and evaluation are core components of every major AI or ML research project. The same is true for AutoGen. To this end, today we are releasing AutoGenBench, a standalone command line tool that we have been using to guide development of AutoGen. Conveniently, AutoGenBench handles: downloading, configuring, running, and reporting results of agents on various public benchmark datasets. In addition to reporting top-line numbers, each AutoGenBench run produces a comprehensive set of logs and telemetry that can be used for debugging, profiling, computing custom metrics, and as input to <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/20/AgentEval" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AgentEval</a>. In the remainder of this blog post, we outline core design principles for AutoGenBench (key to understanding its operation); present a guide to installing and running AutoGenBench; outline a roadmap for evaluation; and conclude with an open call for contributions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-principles">Design Principles<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/25/AutoGenBench#design-principles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design Principles" title="Direct link to Design Principles">​</a></h2>
<p>AutoGenBench is designed around three core design principles. Knowing these principles will help you understand the tool, its operation and its output. These three principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Repetition:</strong> LLMs are stochastic, and in many cases, so too is the code they write to solve problems. For example, a Python script might call an external search engine, and the results may vary run-to-run. This can lead to variance in agent performance. Repetition is key to measuring and understanding this variance. To this end, AutoGenBench is built from the ground up with an understanding that tasks may be run multiple times, and that variance is a metric we often want to measure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation:</strong> Agents interact with their worlds in both subtle and overt ways. For example an agent may install a python library or write a file to disk. This can lead to ordering effects that can impact future measurements. Consider, for example, comparing two agents on a common benchmark. One agent may appear more efficient than the other simply because it ran second, and benefitted from the hard work the first agent did in installing and debugging necessary Python libraries. To address this, AutoGenBench isolates each task in its own Docker container. This ensures that all runs start with the same initial conditions.  (Docker is also a <em>much safer way to run agent-produced code</em>, in general.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> While top-line metrics are great for comparing agents or models, we often want much more information about how the agents are performing, where they are getting stuck, and how they can be improved. We may also later think of new research questions that require computing a different set of metrics. To this end, AutoGenBench is designed to log everything, and to compute metrics from those logs. This ensures that one can always go back to the logs to answer questions about what happened, run profiling software, or feed the logs into tools like <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/20/AgentEval" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AgentEval</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installing-and-running-autogenbench">Installing and Running AutoGenBench<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/25/AutoGenBench#installing-and-running-autogenbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing and Running AutoGenBench" title="Direct link to Installing and Running AutoGenBench">​</a></h2>
<p>As noted above, isolation is a key design principle, and so AutoGenBench must be run in an environment where Docker is available (desktop or Engine). <strong>It will not run in GitHub codespaces</strong>, unless you opt for native execution (which is strongly discouraged). To install Docker Desktop see <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/</a>.
Once Docker is installed, AutoGenBench can then be installed as a standalone tool from PyPI. With <code>pip</code>, installation can be achieved as follows:</p>

<p>After installation, you must configure your API keys. As with other AutoGen applications, AutoGenBench will look for the OpenAI keys in the OAI_CONFIG_LIST file in the current working directory, or the OAI_CONFIG_LIST environment variable. This behavior can be overridden using a command-line parameter.</p>
<p>If you will be running multiple benchmarks, it is often most convenient to leverage the environment variable option. You can load your keys into the environment variable by executing:</p>

<p>From this output we can see the results of the three separate repetitions of each task, and final summary statistics of each run. In this case, the results were generated via GPT-4 (as defined in the OAI_CONFIG_LIST that was provided), and used the <code>TwoAgents</code> template. <strong>It is important to remember that AutoGenBench evaluates <em>specific</em> end-to-end configurations of agents (as opposed to evaluating a model or cognitive framework more generally).</strong></p>
<p>Finally, complete execution traces and logs can be found in the <code>Results</code> folder. See the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/samples/tools/autogenbench/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoGenBench README</a> for more details about command-line options and output formats. Each of these commands also offers extensive in-line help via:</p>

<p>While we are announcing AutoGenBench, we note that it is very much an evolving project in its own right. Over the next few weeks and months we hope to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Onboard many additional benchmarks beyond those shipping today</li>
<li>Greatly improve logging and telemetry</li>
<li>Introduce new core metrics including total costs, task completion time, conversation turns, etc.</li>
<li>Provide tighter integration with AgentEval and AutoGen Studio</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we want to end this blog post with an open call for contributions. AutoGenBench is still nascent, and has much opportunity for improvement.  New benchmarks are constantly being published, and will need to be added. Everyone may have their own distinct set of metrics that they care most about optimizing, and these metrics should be onboarded. To this end, we welcome any and all contributions to this corner of the AutoGen project. If contributing is something that interests you, please see the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/samples/tools/autogenbench/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributor’s guide</a> and join our <a href="https://discord.gg/pAbnFJrkgZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> discussion in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1153072414184452236/1199851779328847902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#autogenbench</a> channel!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AutoGen 0.2.8 enhances operational safety by making 'code execution inside a Docker container' the default setting, focusing on informing users about its operations and empowering them to make informed decisions regarding code execution.</p>
<p>The new release introduces a breaking change where the <code>use_docker</code> argument is set to <code>True</code> by default in code executing agents. This change underscores our commitment to prioritizing security and safety in AutoGen.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/23/Code-execution-in-docker#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>AutoGen has code-executing agents, usually defined as a <code>UserProxyAgent</code>, where code execution is by default ON. Until now, unless explicitly specified by the user, any code generated by other agents would be executed by code-execution agents locally, i.e. wherever AutoGen was being executed. If AutoGen happened to be run in a docker container then the risks of running code were minimized. However, if AutoGen runs outside of Docker, it's easy particularly for new users to overlook code-execution risks.</p>
<p>AutoGen has now changed to by default execute any code inside a docker container (unless execution is already happening inside a docker container). It will launch a Docker image (either user-provided or default), execute the new code, and then terminate the image, preparing for the next code execution cycle.</p>
<p>We understand that not everyone is concerned about this especially when playing around with AutoGen for the first time. We have provided easy ways to turn this requirement off. But we believe that making sure that the user is aware of the fact that code will be executed locally, and prompting them to think about the security implications of running code locally is the right step for AutoGen.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="example">Example<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/23/Code-execution-in-docker#example" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Example" title="Direct link to Example">​</a></h2>
<p>The example shows the default behaviour which is that any code generated by assistant agent and executed by user_proxy agent, will attempt to use a docker container to execute the code. If docker is not running, it will throw an error. User can decide to activate docker or opt in for local code execution.</p>

<p>AutoGen 0.2.2 introduces a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/conversable_agent#__init__" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">description</a> field to ConversableAgent (and all subclasses), and changes GroupChat so that it uses agent <code>description</code>s rather than <code>system_message</code>s when choosing which agents should speak next.</p>
<p>This is expected to simplify GroupChat’s job, improve orchestration, and make it easier to implement new GroupChat or GroupChat-like alternatives.</p>
<p>If you are a developer, and things were already working well for you, no action is needed -- backward compatibility is ensured because the <code>description</code> field defaults to the <code>system_message</code> when no description is provided.</p>
<p>However, if you were struggling with getting GroupChat to work, you can now try updating the <code>description</code> field.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/29/AgentDescriptions#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>As AutoGen matures and developers build increasingly complex combinations of agents, orchestration is becoming an important capability. At present, <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/groupchat#groupchat-objects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GroupChat</a> and the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/groupchat#groupchatmanager-objects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GroupChatManager</a> are the main built-in tools for orchestrating conversations between 3 or more agents. For orchestrators like GroupChat to work well, they need to know something about each agent so that they can decide who should speak and when. Prior to AutoGen 0.2.2, GroupChat relied on each agent's <code>system_message</code> and <code>name</code> to learn about each participating agent. This is likely fine when the system prompt is short and sweet, but can lead to problems when the instructions are very long (e.g., with the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/assistant_agent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AssistantAgent</a>), or non-existent (e.g., with the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/user_proxy_agent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UserProxyAgent</a>).</p>
<p>AutoGen 0.2.2 introduces a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/conversable_agent#__init__" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">description</a> field to all agents, and replaces the use of the <code>system_message</code> for orchestration in GroupChat and all future orchestrators. The <code>description</code> field defaults to the <code>system_message</code> to ensure backwards compatibility, so you may not need to change anything with your code if things are working well for you. However, if you were struggling with GroupChat, give setting the <code>description</code> field a try.</p>
<p>The remainder of this post provides an example of how using the <code>description</code> field simplifies GroupChat's job,  provides some evidence of its effectiveness, and provides tips for writing good descriptions.</p>

<p>As you can see, this description is super confusing:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is hard to make out where each agent's role-description ends</li>
<li><code>You</code> appears numerous times, and refers to three separate agents (GroupChatManager, AssistantAgent, and GuardrailsAgent)</li>
<li>It takes a lot of tokens!</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, it's not hard to see why the GroupChat manager sometimes struggles with this orchestration task.</p>
<p>With AutoGen 0.2.2 onward, GroupChat instead relies on the description field. With a description field the orchestration prompt becomes:</p>

<p>This is much easier to parse and understand, and it doesn't use nearly as many tokens. Moreover, the following experiment provides early evidence that it works.</p>

<p>To illustrate the impact of the <code>description</code> field, we set up a three-agent experiment with a reduced 26-problem subset of the HumanEval benchmark. Here, three agents were added to a GroupChat to solve programming problems. The three agents were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coder (default Assistant prompt)</li>
<li>UserProxy (configured to execute code)</li>
<li>ExecutiveChef (added as a distraction)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Coder and UserProxy used the AssistantAgent and UserProxy defaults (provided above), while the ExecutiveChef was given the system prompt:</p>

<p>The ExecutiveChef is clearly the distractor here -- given that no HumanEval problems are food-related, the GroupChat should rarely consult with the chef. However, when configured with GPT-3.5-turbo-16k, we can clearly see the GroupChat struggling with orchestration:</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="with-versions-prior-to-022-using-system_message">With versions prior to 0.2.2, using <code>system_message</code>:<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/29/AgentDescriptions#with-versions-prior-to-022-using-system_message" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to with-versions-prior-to-022-using-system_message" title="Direct link to with-versions-prior-to-022-using-system_message">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Agents solve 3 out of 26 problems on their first turn</li>
<li>The ExecutiveChef is called upon 54 times! (almost as much as the Coder at 68 times)</li>
</ul>

<li>The Agents solve 7 out of 26 problems on the first turn</li>
<li>The ExecutiveChef is called upon 27 times! (versus 84 times for the Coder)</li>

<p>Since <code>descriptions</code> serve a different purpose than <code>system_message</code>s, it is worth reviewing what makes a good agent description. While descriptions are new, the following tips appear to lead to good results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using the 1st or 2nd person perspective. Descriptions should not contain "I" or "You", unless perhaps "You" is in reference to the GroupChat / orchestrator</li>
<li>Include any details that might help the orchestrator know when to call upon the agent</li>
<li>Keep descriptions short (e.g., "A helpful AI assistant with strong natural language and Python coding skills.").</li>
</ul>
<p>The main thing to remember is that <strong>the description is for the benefit of the GroupChatManager, not for the Agent's own use or instruction</strong>.</p>

<p>AutoGen 0.2.2 introduces a <code>description</code>, becoming the main way agents describe themselves to orchestrators like GroupChat. Since the <code>description</code> defaults to the <code>system_message</code>, there's nothing you need to change if you were already satisfied with how your group chats were working. However, we expect this feature to generally improve orchestration, so please consider experimenting with the <code>description</code> field if you are struggling with GroupChat or want to boost performance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>
Introducing <strong>AgentOptimizer</strong>, a new class for training LLM agents in the era of LLMs as a service.
<strong>AgentOptimizer</strong> is able to prompt autogen agents to iteratively optimize its function/skills according to the historical conversation and performance.
Checkout one implementation for <strong>AgentOptimizer</strong> on <a href="https://github.com/hendrycks/math" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MATH</a> dataset

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/23/AgentOptimizer#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>In traditional ML pipeline, we train a model by updating its weights according to the loss on the training set, while in the era of LLM agents, how should we train an agent?
Here, we take an initial step towards the agent training.
Inspired by the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">function calling</a> capabilities provided by OpenAI,
we draw an analogy between model weights and agent functions/skills, and update an agent’s functions/skills based on its historical performance on a training set.
Specifically, we propose to use the function calling capabilities to formulate the actions that optimize the agents’ functions as a set of function calls,
to support iteratively <strong>adding, revising, and removing</strong> existing functions.
As an agentic way of training an agent, our approach helps enhance the agents’ abilities without requiring access to the LLMs weights.</p>

<p><strong>AgentOptimizer</strong> is a class designed to optimize the agents by improving their function calls.
It contains two core methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>step()</code>: <code>step()</code> takes three inputs, including the previous conversation history (history), the statistical information of solving previous problems (statistic), and the current functions (current_functions).</li>
</ol>
<div class="language-python codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-python codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">actions</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">,</span><span class="token plain"> updated_functions </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> AgentOptimizer</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">.</span><span class="token plain">step</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token plain">history</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">,</span><span class="token plain"> statistic</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">,</span><span class="token plain"> current_functions</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>It has two outputs <code>actions</code> and <code>updated_functions</code>. <code>actions</code> is a series of actions to manipulate the current functions. And <code>updated_functions</code> is the updated functions after the actions are applied (including code implementation).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><code>update_function_call()</code>:
This method takes the agents and actions as input. It updates the functions registered in these agents according to the actions from <code>step()</code>.
For AssistantAgent, it first uses <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/conversable_agent/#update_function_signature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update_function_signature</a> to update the function signatures.
Then, it updates the functions in the MathUserproxyAgent with the corresponding code implementation gained from <code>step()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, the function signatures (JSON schema) returned by the <code>step()</code> may not be valid, and the generated code may also face syntax errors.
<strong>AgentOptimizer</strong> includes mechanisms to check the (1) validity of the function signatures and (2) code implementation before updating the functions.
Moreover, it also includes mechanisms to check whether each action is feasible, such as avoiding the removal of a function that is not in the current functions due to hallucination.</p>

<p>Given a prepared training dataset, the agents iteratively solve problems from the training set to obtain conversation history and statistical information.
The functions are then improved using AgentOptimizer.
Each iteration can be regarded as one training step analogous to traditional machine learning, with the optimization elements being the functions that agents have.
After EPOCH iterations, the agents are expected to obtain better functions that may be used in future tasks</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-implementation-technology-behind-the-agentoptimizer">The implementation technology behind the AgentOptimizer<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/23/AgentOptimizer#the-implementation-technology-behind-the-agentoptimizer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The implementation technology behind the AgentOptimizer" title="Direct link to The implementation technology behind the AgentOptimizer">​</a></h2>
<p>To obtain stable and structured function signatures and code implementations from AgentOptimizer,
we leverage the function calling capabilities provided by OpenAI to formulate the actions that manipulate the functions as a set of function calls.
Specifically, we introduce three function calls to manipulate the current functions at each step: <code>add_function</code>, <code>remove_function</code>, and <code>revise_function</code>.
These calls add, remove, and revise functions in the existing function list, respectively.
This practice could fully leverages the function calling capabilities of GPT-4 and outputs structured functions with more stable signatures and code implementation.
Below is the JSON schema of these function calls:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>add_function</code>: Add one new function that may be used in the future tasks.</li>
</ol>

<li>Unlike gradient descent in traditional machine learning training processes, each optimization step does not necessarily lead to better performance on the training set.
When the training epoch is small, the agent’s performance may even decrease. One urgent task is to design a better mechanism to guide the optimization process.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_agentoptimizer.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current implementation</a> of AgentOptimizer is mainly for illustration purpose and is just a proof of concept.
It is not formally integrated into the autogen with a general interface like optimizing any kinds of agents in any tasks.
Currently, it only supports optimizing the multi-agent system in solving problems from <a href="https://github.com/hendrycks/math" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MATH</a> dataset. We will integrate it into autogen with more general interface in the future.</li>

<p>To help you rapidly prototype multi-agent solutions for your tasks, we are introducing AutoGen Studio, an interface powered by <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/autogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoGen</a>. It allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declaratively define and modify agents and multi-agent workflows through a point and click, drag and drop interface (e.g., you can select the parameters of two agents that will communicate to solve your task).</li>
<li>Use our UI to create chat sessions with the specified agents and view results (e.g., view chat history, generated files, and time taken).</li>
<li>Explicitly add skills to your agents and accomplish more tasks.</li>
<li>Publish your sessions to a local gallery.</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoGen Studio is open source <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/autogen-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code here</a>, and can be installed via pip.  Give it a try!</p>

<p>The accelerating pace of technology has ushered us into an era where digital assistants (or agents) are becoming integral to our lives. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/autogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoGen</a> has emerged as a leading framework for orchestrating the power of agents. In the spirit of expanding this frontier and democratizing this capability, we are thrilled to introduce a new user-friendly interface: <strong>AutoGen Studio</strong>.</p>
<p>With AutoGen Studio, users can rapidly create, manage, and interact with agents that can learn, adapt, and collaborate. As we release this interface into the open-source community, our ambition is not only to enhance productivity but to inspire a level of personalized interaction between humans and agents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: AutoGen Studio is meant to help you rapidly prototype multi-agent workflows and demonstrate an example of end user interfaces built with AutoGen. It is not meant to be a production-ready app.</p>

<p>To get started, you need access to a language model. You can get this set up by following the steps in the AutoGen documentation <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Configure your environment with either <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> or <code>AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY</code>.</p>
<p>For example, in your terminal, you would set the API key like this:</p>

<p>There are two ways to install AutoGen Studio - from PyPi or from source. We <strong>recommend installing from PyPi</strong> unless you plan to modify the source code.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Install from PyPi</strong></p>
<p>We recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., conda) to avoid conflicts with existing Python packages. With Python 3.10 or newer active in your virtual environment, use pip to install AutoGen Studio:</p>

<p><strong>Install from Source</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This approach requires some familiarity with building interfaces in React.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you prefer to install from source, ensure you have Python 3.10+ and Node.js (version above 14.15.0) installed. Here's how you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clone the AutoGen Studio repository and install its Python dependencies:</p>

<p>The AutoGen Studio UI is organized into 3 high level sections - <strong>Build</strong>, <strong>Playground</strong>, and <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="build">Build<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenStudio#build" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Build" title="Direct link to Build">​</a></h3>

<p>This section focuses on defining the properties of agents and agent workflows. It includes the following concepts:</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Skills are functions (e.g., Python functions) that describe how to solve a task. In general, a good skill has a descriptive name (e.g. <code>generate_images</code>), extensive docstrings and good defaults (e.g., writing out files to disk for persistence and reuse). You can add new skills to AutoGen Studio via the provided UI. At inference time, these skills are made available to the assistant agent as they address your tasks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="View and add skills." src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/autogenstudio_skills-7376f0a5aec5917fda817a4793f2b89a.png" width="1533" height="957" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p align="center"><em>AutoGen Studio Build View: View, add or edit skills that an agent can leverage in addressing tasks.</em></p><p></p>
<p><strong>Agents</strong>: This provides an interface to declaratively specify properties for an AutoGen agent (mirrors most of the members of a base <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoGen conversable agent</a> class).</p>
<p><strong>Agent Workflows</strong>: An agent workflow is a specification of a set of agents that can work together to accomplish a task. The simplest version of this is a setup with two agents – a user proxy agent (that represents a user i.e. it compiles code and prints result) and an assistant that can address task requests (e.g., generating plans, writing code, evaluating responses, proposing error recovery steps, etc.). A more complex flow could be a group chat where even more agents work towards a solution.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="playground">Playground<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenStudio#playground" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Playground" title="Direct link to Playground">​</a></h3>

</p><p align="center"><em>AutoGen Studio Playground View: Agents collaborate, use available skills (ability to generate images) to address a user task (generate pdf's).</em></p><p></p>
<p>The playground section is focused on interacting with agent workflows defined in the previous build section. It includes the following concepts:</p>
<p><strong>Session</strong>: A session refers to a period of continuous interaction or engagement with an agent workflow, typically characterized by a sequence of activities or operations aimed at achieving specific objectives. It includes the agent workflow configuration, the interactions between the user and the agents. A session can be “published” to a “gallery”.</p>
<p><strong>Chat View</strong>: A chat is a sequence of interactions between a user and an agent. It is a part of a session.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gallery">Gallery<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenStudio#gallery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Gallery" title="Direct link to Gallery">​</a></h3>
<p>This section is focused on sharing and reusing artifacts (e.g., workflow configurations, sessions, etc.).</p>
<p>AutoGen Studio comes with 3 example skills: <code>fetch_profile</code>, <code>find_papers</code>, <code>generate_images</code>. Please feel free to review the repo to learn more about how they work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-autogen-studio-api">The AutoGen Studio API<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenStudio#the-autogen-studio-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The AutoGen Studio API" title="Direct link to The AutoGen Studio API">​</a></h2>
<p>While  AutoGen Studio is a web interface, it is powered by an underlying python API that is reusable and modular. Importantly, we have implemented an API where agent workflows can be declaratively specified (in JSON), loaded and run. An example of the current API is shown below. Please consult the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/autogen-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoGen Studio repo</a> for more details.</p>

<p>As we continue to develop and refine AutoGen Studio, the road map below outlines an array of enhancements and new features planned for future releases. Here's what users can look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Agent Workflows</strong>: We're working on integrating support for more sophisticated agent workflows, such as <code>GroupChat</code>, allowing for richer interaction between multiple agents or dynamic topologies.</li>
<li><strong>Improved User Experience</strong>: This includes features like streaming intermediate model output for real-time feedback, better summarization of agent responses, information on costs of each interaction. We will also invest in improving the workflow for composing and reusing agents. We will also explore support for more interactive human in the loop feedback to agents.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Agent Skills</strong>: We will work towards improving the workflow for authoring, composing and reusing agent skills.</li>
<li><strong>Community Features</strong>: Facilitation of sharing and collaboration within AutoGen Studio user community is a key goal. We're exploring options for sharing sessions and results more easily among users and contributing to a shared repository of skills, agents, and agent workflows.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="faq">FAQ<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenStudio#faq" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FAQ" title="Direct link to FAQ">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I adjust the default skills, agent and workflow configurations?</strong>
A: You can modify agent configurations directly from the UI or by editing the <code>autogentstudio/utils/dbdefaults.json</code> file which is used to initialize the database.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I want to reset the entire conversation with an agent, how do I go about it?</strong>
A: To reset your conversation history, you can delete the <code>database.sqlite</code> file. If you need to clear user-specific data, remove the relevant <code>autogenstudio/web/files/user/&lt;user_id_md5hash&gt;</code> folder.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is it possible to view the output and messages generated by the agents during interactions?</strong>
A: Yes, you can view the generated messages in the debug console of the web UI, providing insights into the agent interactions. Alternatively, you can inspect the <code>database.sqlite</code> file for a comprehensive record of messages.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I find documentation and support for AutoGen Studio?</strong>
A: We are constantly working to improve AutoGen Studio. For the latest updates, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/autogen-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoGen Studio Readme</a>. For additional support, please open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> or ask questions on <a href="https://discord.gg/pAbnFJrkgZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I use Other Models with AutoGen Studio?</strong>
Yes. AutoGen standardizes on the openai model api format, and you can use any api server that offers an openai compliant endpoint. In the AutoGen Studio UI, each agent has an <code>llm_config</code> field where you can input your model endpoint details including <code>model name</code>, <code>api key</code>, <code>base url</code>, <code>model type</code> and <code>api version</code>. For Azure OpenAI models, you can find these details in the Azure portal. Note that for Azure OpenAI, the <code>model name</code> is the deployment id or engine, and the <code>model type</code> is "azure".
For other OSS models, we recommend using a server such as vllm to instantiate an openai compliant endpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The Server Starts But I Can't Access the UI</strong>
A: If you are running the server on a remote machine (or a local machine that fails to resolve localhost correstly), you may need to specify the host address. By default, the host address is set to <code>localhost</code>.  You can specify the host address using the <code>--host &lt;host&gt;</code> argument. For example, to start the server on port 8081 and local address such that it is accessible from other machines on the network, you can run the following command:</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>
Introducing <strong>AutoBuild</strong>, building multi-agent system automatically, fast, and easily for complex tasks with minimal
user prompt required, powered by a new designed class <strong>AgentBuilder</strong>. AgentBuilder also supports open-source LLMs by
leveraging <a href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vLLM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FastChat</a>.

<p>In this blog, we introduce <strong>AutoBuild</strong>, a pipeline that can automatically build multi-agent systems for complex tasks.
Specifically, we design a new class called <strong>AgentBuilder</strong>, which will complete the generation of participant expert agents
and the construction of group chat automatically after the user provides descriptions of a building task and an execution task.</p>
<p>AgentBuilder supports open-source models on Hugging Face powered by <a href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vLLM</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FastChat</a>. Once the user chooses to use open-source LLM, AgentBuilder will set
up an endpoint server automatically without any user participation.</p>

<p>If <code>coding</code> is not specified, AgentBuilder will determine on its own whether the user proxy should be added or not according to the task.
The generated <code>agent_list</code> is a list of <code>AssistantAgent</code> instances.
If <code>coding</code> is true, a user proxy (a <code>UserProxyAssistant</code> instance) will be added as the first element to the <code>agent_list</code>.
<code>agent_configs</code> is a list of agent configurations including agent name, backbone LLM model, and system message.

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a developer of an LLM-powered application, how can you assess the utility it brings to end users while helping them with their tasks?</li>
<li>To shed light on the question above, we introduce <code>AgentEval</code> — the first version of the framework to assess the utility of any LLM-powered application crafted to assist users in specific tasks.  AgentEval aims to simplify the evaluation process by automatically proposing a set of criteria tailored to the unique purpose of your application. This allows for a comprehensive assessment, quantifying the utility of your application against the suggested criteria.</li>
<li>We demonstrate how <code>AgentEval</code> work using <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/06/28/MathChat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">math problems dataset</a> as an example in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agenteval_cq_math.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following notebook</a>.

<p>AutoGen aims to simplify the development of LLM-powered multi-agent systems for various applications, ultimately making end users' lives easier by assisting with their tasks. Next, we all yearn to understand how our developed systems perform, their utility for users, and, perhaps most crucially, how we can enhance them. Directly evaluating multi-agent systems poses challenges as current approaches predominantly rely on success metrics – essentially, whether the agent accomplishes tasks. However, comprehending user interaction with a system involves far more than success alone. Take math problems, for instance; it's not merely about the agent solving the problem. Equally significant is its ability to convey solutions based on various criteria, including completeness, conciseness, and the clarity of the provided explanation. Furthermore, success isn't always clearly defined for every task.</p>
<p>Rapid advances in LLMs and multi-agent systems have brought forth many emerging capabilities that we're keen on translating into tangible utilities for end users. We introduce the first version of <code>AgentEval</code> framework - a tool crafted to empower developers in swiftly gauging the utility of LLM-powered applications designed to help end users accomplish the desired task.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Fig.2: An overview of the tasks taxonomy" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/tasks-taxonomy-c4b7c6fe465e12dddde9235c3ee8c281.png" width="1954" height="1111" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p align="center"><em>Fig. 2 provides  an overview of the tasks taxonomy</em></p><p></p>
<p>Let's first look into an overview of the suggested task taxonomy that a multi-agent system can be designed for. In general, the tasks can be split into two types, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Success is not clearly defined</em> - refer to instances when users utilize a system in an assistive manner, seeking suggestions rather than expecting the system to solve the task. For example, a user might request the system to generate an email. In many cases, this generated content serves as a template that the user will later edit. However, defining success precisely for such tasks is relatively complex.</li>
<li><em>Success is clearly defined</em> - refer to instances where we can clearly define whether a system solved the task or not. Consider agents that assist in accomplishing household tasks, where the definition of success is clear and measurable. This category can be further divided into two separate subcategories:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><em>The optimal solution exits</em> - these are tasks where only one solution is possible. For example, if you ask your assistant to turn on the light, the success of this task is clearly defined, and there is only one way to accomplish it.</li>
<li><em>Multiple solutions exist</em> - increasingly, we observe situations where multiple trajectories of agent behavior can lead to either success or failure. In such cases, it is crucial to differentiate between the various successful and unsuccessful trajectories. For example, when you ask the agent to suggest you a food recipe or tell you a joke.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In our <code>AgentEval</code> framework, we are currently focusing on tasks where <em>Success is clearly defined</em>. Next, we will introduce the suggested framework.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="agenteval-framework"><code>AgentEval</code> Framework<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/20/AgentEval#agenteval-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to agenteval-framework" title="Direct link to agenteval-framework">​</a></h2>
<p>Our previous research on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/iglu-datasets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assistive agents in Minecraft</a> suggested that the most optimal way to obtain human judgments is to present humans with two agents side by side and ask for preferences. In this setup of pairwise comparison, humans can develop criteria to explain why they prefer the behavior of one agent over another. For instance, <em>'the first agent was faster in execution,'</em> or <em>'the second agent moves more naturally.'</em> So, the comparative nature led humans to come up with a list of criteria that helps to infer the utility of the task. With this idea in mind, we designed <code>AgentEval</code> (shown in Fig. 1), where we employ LLMs to help us understand, verify, and assess task <em>utility</em> for the multi-agent system. Namely:</p>
<ul>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="agenteval-results-based-on-math-problems-dataset"><code>AgentEval</code> Results based on Math Problems Dataset<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/20/AgentEval#agenteval-results-based-on-math-problems-dataset" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to agenteval-results-based-on-math-problems-dataset" title="Direct link to agenteval-results-based-on-math-problems-dataset">​</a></h2>
<p>As an example, after running CriticAgent, we obtained the following criteria to verify the results for math problem dataset:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Criteria</th><th>Description</th><th>Accepted Values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Problem Interpretation</td><td>Ability to correctly interpret the problem</td><td>["completely off", "slightly relevant", "relevant", "mostly accurate", "completely accurate"]</td></tr><tr><td>Mathematical Methodology</td><td>Adequacy of the chosen mathematical or algorithmic methodology for the question</td><td>["inappropriate", "barely adequate", "adequate", "mostly effective", "completely effective"]</td></tr><tr><td>Calculation Correctness</td><td>Accuracy of calculations made and solutions given</td><td>["completely incorrect", "mostly incorrect", "neither", "mostly correct", "completely correct"]</td></tr><tr><td>Explanation Clarity</td><td>Clarity and comprehensibility of explanations, including language use and structure</td><td>["not at all clear", "slightly clear", "moderately clear", "very clear", "completely clear"]</td></tr><tr><td>Code Efficiency</td><td>Quality of code in terms of efficiency and elegance</td><td>["not at all efficient", "slightly efficient", "moderately efficient", "very efficient", "extremely efficient"]</td></tr><tr><td>Code Correctness</td><td>Correctness of the provided code</td><td>["completely incorrect", "mostly incorrect", "partly correct", "mostly correct", "completely correct"]</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Then, after running QuantifierAgent, we obtained the results presented in Fig. 3, where you can see three models:</p>
<ul>
<li>AgentChat</li>
<li>ReAct</li>
<li>GPT-4 Vanilla Solver</li>
</ul>
<p>Lighter colors represent estimates for failed cases, and brighter colors show how discovered criteria were quantified.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Fig.3: Results based on overall math problems dataset _s stands for successful cases, _f - stands for failed cases" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/math-problems-plot-03ec81b957c85db6ad9b1da353784b96.png" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p align="center"><em>Fig.3 presents results based on overall math problems dataset <code>_s</code> stands for successful cases, <code>_f</code> - stands for failed cases</em></p><p></p>
<p>We note that while applying agentEval to math problems, the agent was not exposed to any ground truth information about the problem. As such, this figure illustrates an estimated performance of the three different agents, namely, Autogen (blue), Gpt-4 (red), and ReAct (green). We observe that by comparing the performance of any of the three agents in successful cases (dark bars of any color) versus unsuccessful cases (lighter version of the same bar), we note that AgentEval was able to assign higher quantification to successful cases than that of failed ones. This observation verifies AgentEval's ability for task utility prediction. Additionally, AgentEval allows us to go beyond just a binary definition of success, enabling a more in-depth comparison between successful and failed cases.</p>
<p>It's important not only to identify what is not working but also to recognize what and why actually went well.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future Work<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/20/AgentEval#limitations-and-future-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Limitations and Future Work" title="Direct link to Limitations and Future Work">​</a></h2>
<p>The current implementation of <code>AgentEval</code> has a number of limitations which are planning to overcome in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of criteria varies per run (unless you store a seed). We would recommend to run <code>CriticAgent</code> at least two times, and pick criteria you think is important for your domain.</li>
<li>The results of the <code>QuantifierAgent</code> can vary with each run, so we recommend conducting multiple runs to observe the extent of result variations.</li>
</ul>
<p>To mitigate the limitations mentioned above, we are working on VerifierAgent, whose goal is to stabilize the results and provide additional explanations.</p>

<p><code>CriticAgent</code> and <code>QuantifierAgent</code> can be applied to the logs of any type of application, providing you with an in-depth understanding of the utility your solution brings to the user for a given task.</p>

<p>OpenAI assistants are now integrated into AutoGen via <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/autogen/agentchat/contrib/gpt_assistant_agent.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>GPTAssistantAgent</code></a>.
This enables multiple OpenAI assistants, which form the backend of the now popular GPTs, to collaborate and tackle complex tasks.

<p>Earlier last week, OpenAI introduced <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPTs</a>, giving users ability to create custom ChatGPTs tailored for them.
<em>But what if these individual GPTs could collaborate to do even more?</em>
Fortunately, because of AutoGen, this is now a reality!
AutoGen has been pioneering agents and supporting <a href="https://aka.ms/autogen-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-agent workflows</a> since earlier this year, and now (starting with version 0.2.0b5) we are introducing compatibility with the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assistant API</a>, which is currently in beta preview.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we've added a new (experimental) agent called the <code>GPTAssistantAgent</code> that
lets you seamlessly add these new OpenAI assistants into AutoGen-based multi-agent workflows.
This integration shows great potential and synergy, and we plan to continue enhancing it.</p>

<p>In this blog, we introduce the <strong>EcoAssistant</strong>, a system built upon AutoGen with the goal of solving user queries more accurately and affordably.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="problem-setup">Problem setup<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/09/EcoAssistant#problem-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Problem setup" title="Direct link to Problem setup">​</a></h3>
<p>Recently, users have been using conversational LLMs such as ChatGPT for various queries.
Reports indicate that 23% of ChatGPT user queries are for knowledge extraction purposes.
Many of these queries require knowledge that is external to the information stored within any pre-trained large language models (LLMs).
These tasks can only be completed by generating code to fetch necessary information via external APIs that contain the requested information.
In the table below, we show three types of user queries that we aim to address in this work.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Dataset</th><th>API</th><th>Example query</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Places</td><td><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Places</a></td><td>I’m looking for a 24-hour pharmacy in Montreal, can you find one for me?</td></tr><tr><td>Weather</td><td><a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weather API</a></td><td>What is the current cloud coverage in Mumbai, India?</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td><a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpha Vantage Stock API</a></td><td>Can you give me the opening price of Microsoft for the month of January 2023?</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="leveraging-external-apis">Leveraging external APIs<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/09/EcoAssistant#leveraging-external-apis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Leveraging external APIs" title="Direct link to Leveraging external APIs">​</a></h3>
<p>To address these queries, we first build a <strong>two-agent system</strong> based on AutoGen,
where the first agent is a <strong>LLM assistant agent</strong> (<code>AssistantAgent</code> in AutoGen) that is responsible for proposing and refining the code and
the second agent is a <strong>code executor agent</strong> (<code>UserProxyAgent</code> in AutoGen) that would extract the generated code and execute it, forwarding the output back to the LLM assistant agent.
A visualization of the two-agent system is shown below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="chat" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/chat-a2adea6a92b3cd4059021840c869d7d5.png" width="2528" height="2467" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>To instruct the assistant agent to leverage external APIs, we only need to add the API name/key dictionary at the beginning of the initial message.
The template is shown below, where the red part is the information of APIs and black part is user query.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="template" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/template-c610ae53eaa7afa3adaf670fa74b5c10.png" width="1678" height="501" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Importantly, we don't want to reveal our real API key to the assistant agent for safety concerns.
Therefore, we use a <strong>fake API key</strong> to replace the real API key in the initial message.
In particular, we generate a random token (e.g., <code>181dbb37</code>) for each API key and replace the real API key with the token in the initial message.
Then, when the code executor execute the code, the fake API key would be automatically replaced by the real API key.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solution-demonstration">Solution Demonstration<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/09/EcoAssistant#solution-demonstration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solution Demonstration" title="Direct link to Solution Demonstration">​</a></h3>
<p>In most practical scenarios, queries from users would appear sequentially over time.
Our <strong>EcoAssistant</strong> leverages past success to help the LLM assistants address future queries via <strong>Solution Demonstration</strong>.
Specifically, whenever a query is deemed successfully resolved by user feedback, we capture and store the query and the final generated code snippet.
These query-code pairs are saved in a specialized vector database. When new queries appear, <strong>EcoAssistant</strong> retrieves the most similar query from the database, which is then appended with the associated code to the initial prompt for the new query, serving as a demonstration.
The new template of initial message is shown below, where the blue part corresponds to the solution demonstration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="template" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/template-demo-5a8cae3df56acdcf73188e401ad739f5.png" width="1089" height="544" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We found that this utilization of past successful query-code pairs improves the query resolution process with fewer iterations and enhances the system's performance.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assistant-hierarchy">Assistant Hierarchy<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/09/EcoAssistant#assistant-hierarchy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assistant Hierarchy" title="Direct link to Assistant Hierarchy">​</a></h3>
<p>LLMs usually have different prices and performance, for example, GPT-3.5-turbo is much cheaper than GPT-4 but also less accurate.
Thus, we propose the <strong>Assistant Hierarchy</strong> to reduce the cost of using LLMs.
The core idea is that we use the cheaper LLMs first and only use the more expensive LLMs when necessary.
By this way, we are able to reduce the reliance on expensive LLMs and thus reduce the cost.
In particular, given multiple LLMs, we initiate one assistant agent for each and start the conversation with the most cost-effective LLM assistant.
If the conversation between the current LLM assistant and the code executor concludes without successfully resolving the query, <strong>EcoAssistant</strong> would then restart the conversation with the next more expensive LLM assistant in the hierarchy.
We found that this strategy significantly reduces costs while still effectively addressing queries.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-synergistic-effect">A Synergistic Effect<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/09/EcoAssistant#a-synergistic-effect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Synergistic Effect" title="Direct link to A Synergistic Effect">​</a></h3>
<p>We found that the <strong>Assistant Hierarchy</strong> and <strong>Solution Demonstration</strong> of <strong>EcoAssistant</strong> have a synergistic effect.
Because the query-code database is shared by all LLM assistants, even without specialized design,
the solution from more powerful LLM assistant (e.g., GPT-4) could be later retrieved to guide weaker LLM assistant (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo).
Such a synergistic effect further improves the performance and reduces the cost of <strong>EcoAssistant</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experimental-results">Experimental Results<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/09/EcoAssistant#experimental-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Experimental Results" title="Direct link to Experimental Results">​</a></h3>
<p>We evaluate <strong>EcoAssistant</strong> on three datasets: Places, Weather, and Stock. When comparing it with a single GPT-4 assistant, we found that <strong>EcoAssistant</strong> achieves a higher success rate with a lower cost as shown in the figure below.

<p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) augment large language models (LLMs) with the ability to process multi-sensory data.</p>
<p>This blog post and the latest AutoGen update concentrate on visual comprehension. Users can input images, pose questions about them, and receive text-based responses from these LMMs.
We support the <code>gpt-4-vision-preview</code> model from OpenAI and <code>LLaVA</code> model from Microsoft now.</p>
<p>Here, we emphasize the <strong>Multimodal Conversable Agent</strong> and the <strong>LLaVA Agent</strong> due to their growing popularity.
GPT-4V represents the forefront in image comprehension, while LLaVA is an efficient model, fine-tuned from LLama-2.</p>

<p>The <code>MultimodalConversableAgent</code> interprets the input prompt, extracting images from local or internet sources.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advanced-usage">Advanced Usage<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/06/LMM-Agent#advanced-usage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advanced Usage" title="Direct link to Advanced Usage">​</a></h2>
<p>Similar to other AutoGen agents, multimodal agents support multi-round dialogues with other agents, code generation, factual queries, and management via a GroupChat interface.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>FigureCreator</code> in our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_lmm_gpt-4v.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-4V notebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_lmm_llava.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLaVA notebook</a> integrates two agents: a coder (an AssistantAgent) and critics (a multimodal agent).
The coder drafts Python code for visualizations, while the critics provide insights for enhancement. Collaboratively, these agents aim to refine visual outputs.
With <code>human_input_mode=ALWAYS</code>, you can also contribute suggestions for better visualizations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Teachable Agent Architecture" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/teachable-arch-2d85f7f511a1677c5d5fb19af7ab91ad.png" width="1428" height="686" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We introduce <strong>Teachable Agents</strong> so that users can teach their LLM-based assistants new facts, preferences, and skills.</li>
<li>We showcase examples of teachable agents learning and later recalling facts, preferences, and skills in subsequent chats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/10/26/TeachableAgent#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Conversational assistants based on LLMs can remember the current chat with the user, and can also demonstrate in-context learning of user teachings during the conversation. But the assistant's memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. Then in subsequent chats the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.</p>
<p><code>Teachability</code> addresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory implemented as a vector database. Instead of copying all of memory into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memories (called memos) are retrieved into context as needed. This allows the user to teach frequently used facts and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it recall them in later chats.</p>
<p>Any instantiated <code>agent</code> that inherits from <code>ConversableAgent</code> can be made teachable by instantiating a <code>Teachability</code> object and calling its <code>add_to_agent(agent)</code> method.
In order to make effective decisions about memo storage and retrieval, the <code>Teachability</code> object calls an instance of <code>TextAnalyzerAgent</code> (another AutoGen agent) to identify and reformulate text as needed for remembering facts, preferences, and skills. Note that this adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens, which can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for each response.</p>

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token message-id class-name" style="color:rgb(255, 203, 107)">teachable_agent</span><span class="token message-id"> </span><span class="token message-id punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token message-id keyword" style="font-style:italic">to</span><span class="token message-id"> </span><span class="token message-id class-name" style="color:rgb(255, 203, 107)">user</span><span class="token message-id punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token message-id">:</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">- Title: Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">- Innovation: GPT-4, an LLM with remarkable capabilities, demonstrates human-level performance across various domains, like math, coding, vision, medicine, law, and psychology.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">- Key results: GPT-4 significantly surpasses prior models, suggesting it may be an early version of AGI; limitations and challenges toward deeper AGI are also discussed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/10/18/RetrieveChat#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Retrieval augmentation has emerged as a practical and effective approach for mitigating the intrinsic
limitations of LLMs by incorporating external documents. In this blog post, we introduce RAG agents of
AutoGen that allows retrieval-augmented generation. The system consists of two agents: a
Retrieval-augmented User Proxy agent, called <code>RetrieveUserProxyAgent</code>, and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant
agent, called <code>RetrieveAssistantAgent</code>, both of which are extended from built-in agents from AutoGen.
The overall architecture of the RAG agents is shown in the figure above.</p>
<p>To use Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented
User Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy
necessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented
User Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute
embeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively
engage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy retrieves document chunks based on the embedding similarity,
and sends them along with the question to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.</li>
<li>The Retrieval-Augmented Assistant employs an LLM to generate code or text as answers based
on the question and context provided. If the LLM is unable to produce a satisfactory response, it
is instructed to reply with “Update Context” to the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy.</li>
<li>If a response includes code blocks, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy executes the code and
sends the output as feedback. If there are no code blocks or instructions to update the context, it
terminates the conversation. Otherwise, it updates the context and forwards the question along
with the new context to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant. Note that if human input solicitation
is enabled, individuals can proactively send any feedback, including Update Context”, to the
Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.</li>
<li>If the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant receives “Update Context”, it requests the next most similar
chunks of documents as new context from the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy. Otherwise, it
generates new code or text based on the feedback and chat history. If the LLM fails to generate
an answer, it replies with “Update Context” again. This process can be repeated several times.
The conversation terminates if no more documents are available for the context.</li>

<p>RetrieveChat can handle various types of documents. By default, it can process
plain text and PDF files, including formats such as 'txt', 'json', 'csv', 'tsv',
'md', 'html', 'htm', 'rtf', 'rst', 'jsonl', 'log', 'xml', 'yaml', 'yml' and 'pdf'.
If you install <a href="https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installation/full_installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unstructured</a>
(<code>pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"</code>), additional document types such as 'docx',
'doc', 'odt', 'pptx', 'ppt', 'xlsx', 'eml', 'msg', 'epub' will also be supported.</p>
<p>You can find a list of all supported document types by using <code>autogen.retrieve_utils.TEXT_FORMATS</code>.</p>

<p>Before we can store the documents into a vector database, we need to split the texts into chunks. Although
we have implemented a flexible text splitter in autogen, you may still want to use different text splitters.
There are also some existing text split tools which are good to reuse.</p>
<p>For example, you can use all the text splitters in langchain.</p>

<p>To use <code>RetrieveUserProxyAgent</code> in a group chat is almost the same as you use it in a two agents chat. The only thing is that
you need to <strong>initialize the chat with <code>RetrieveUserProxyAgent</code></strong>. The <code>RetrieveAssistantAgent</code> is not necessary in a group chat.</p>
<p>However, you may want to initialize the chat with another agent in some cases. To leverage the best of <code>RetrieveUserProxyAgent</code>,
you'll need to call it from a function.</p>

<p>Normally this will work.

<strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We introduce MathChat, a conversational framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to solve advanced mathematical problems.</strong></li>
<li><strong>MathChat improves LLM's performance on challenging math problem-solving, outperforming basic prompting and other strategies by about 6%. The improvement was especially notable in the Algebra category, with a 15% increase in accuracy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Despite the advancement, GPT-4 still struggles to solve very challenging math problems, even with effective prompting strategies. Further improvements are needed, such as the development of more specific assistant models or the integration of new tools and prompts.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) like GTP-3.5 and GPT-4 have demonstrated astonishing abilities over previous models on various tasks, such as text generation, question answering, and code generation. Moreover, these models can communicate with humans through conversations and remember previous contexts, making it easier for humans to interact with them. These models play an increasingly important role in our daily lives assisting people with different tasks, such as writing emails, summarizing documents, and writing code.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we probe into the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we are interested in their capabilities to solve advanced math problems, which could be representative of a broader class of problems that require precise reasoning and also have deterministic solutions.</p>
<p>We introduce MathChat, a conversational framework designed for solving challenging math problems with LLMs. This framework takes advantage of the chat-optimized feature of state-of-the-art LLMs, where a user proxy agent and an LLM assistant work together to tackle math problems. We also test previous prompting techniques for comparison.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-mathchat-framework">The MathChat Framework<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/06/28/MathChat#the-mathchat-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The MathChat Framework" title="Direct link to The MathChat Framework">​</a></h2>
<p>MathChat simulates a conversation between the LLM assistant and a user proxy agent. As the name indicates, the user proxy agent acts as a proxy for the user, which is responsible for communicating with the LLM assistant and continuing the conversation in a desired manner.</p>
<p>The proxy agent first presents a math problem to the LLM assistant, framed by an initial prompt that guides the assistant in how it should work collaboratively to solve the problem. We incorporate existing prompting methods such as CoT (chain-of-thought) and tool-using are incorporated in the initial prompt. Key components of the prompt include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tool-using Prompt:</strong> This guides the LLM assistant to use Python code in the correct format to address the problem, allowing the user proxy agent to parse the code and provide the appropriate results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem-Solving Strategy Selection Prompt:</strong> The assistant is instructed to choose one of three potential problem-solving strategies, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing a Python program to solve the problem directly.</li>
<li>Solving the problem directly without using Python, which exercises LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities.</li>
<li>Solving the problem step by step with Python. This should be used when the first two strategies aren't suitable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Answer Encapsulation Prompt:</strong> This part instructs the assistant to put the final answer in <em>\boxed</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The prompt design in MathChat is flexible and can easily be refined to include other tools, such as Wolfram Alpha.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example between the <strong>User Proxy Agent</strong> and the <strong>LLM Assistant</strong> (GPT-4). The conversation focuses on how to solve inequality using Python.
(The conversation is modified for readability.)</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Participant</th><th>Dialogue</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User Proxy Agent</td><td>(Initial Prompt: Let's solve a math problem with Python...)

<p>We evaluate the improvement brought by MathChat.</p>
<p>For the experiment, we focus on the level-5 problems from the MATH dataset, which are composed of high school competition problems. These problems include the application of theorems and complex equation derivation and are challenging even for undergraduate students. We evaluate 6 of 7 categories from the dataset (excluding Geometry): Prealgebra, Algebra, Number Theory, Counting and Probability, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus.</p>
<p>We evaluate GPT-4 and use the default configuration of the OpenAI API. To access the final performance, we manually compare the final answer with the correct answer.  For the vanilla prompt, Program Synthesis, and MathChat, we have GPT-4 enclose the final answer in <em>\boxed</em>, and we take the return of the function in PoT as the final answer.</p>
<p>We also evaluate the following methods for comparison:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Vanilla prompting:</strong> Evaluates GPT-4's direct problem-solving capability. The prompt used is: <em>" Solve the problem carefully. Put the final answer in \boxed<!-- -->"</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Program of Thoughts (PoT):</strong> Uses a zero-shot PoT prompt that requests the model to create a <em>Solver</em> function to solve the problem and return the final answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Program Synthesis (PS) prompting:</strong> Like PoT, it prompts the model to write a program to solve the problem. The prompt used is: <em>"Write a program that answers the following question: {Problem}"</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experiment-results">Experiment Results<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/06/28/MathChat#experiment-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Experiment Results" title="Direct link to Experiment Results">​</a></h2>
<p>The accuracy on all the problems with difficulty level-5 from different categories of the MATH dataset with different methods is shown below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Result" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/result-514251f4c387d5b6e11656e1fa33de08.png" width="1470" height="326" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We found that compared to basic prompting, which demonstrates the innate capabilities of GPT-4, utilizing Python within the context of PoT or PS strategy improved the overall accuracy by about 10%. This increase was mostly seen in categories involving more numerical manipulations, such as Counting &amp; Probability and Number Theory, and in more complex categories like Intermediate Algebra and Precalculus.</p>
<p>For categories like Algebra and Prealgebra, PoT and PS showed little improvement, and in some instances, even led to a decrease in accuracy. However, MathChat was able to enhance total accuracy by around 6% compared to PoT and PS, showing competitive performance across all categories. Remarkably, MathChat improved accuracy in the Algebra category by about 15% over other methods. Note that categories like Intermediate Algebra and Precalculus remained challenging for all methods, with only about 20% of problems solved accurately.</p>

<p>Despite MathChat's improvements over previous methods, the results show that complex math problem is still challenging for recent powerful LLMs, like GPT-4, even with help from external tools.</p>
<p>Further work can be done to enhance this framework or math problem-solving in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although enabling the model to use tools like Python can reduce calculation errors, LLMs are still prone to logic errors. Methods like self-consistency (Sample several solutions and take a major vote on the final answer), or self-verification (use another LLM instance to check whether an answer is correct) might improve the performance.</li>
<li>Sometimes, whether the LLM can solve the problem depends on the plan it uses. Some plans require less computation and logical reasoning, leaving less room for mistakes.</li>
<li>MathChat has the potential to be adapted into a copilot system, which could assist users with math problems. This system could allow users to be more involved in the problem-solving process, potentially enhancing learning.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="An adaptive way of using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 outperforms GPT-4 in both coding success rate and inference cost" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/humaneval-b2718b0b15d76b8fc59a4094e1bd684c.png" width="604" height="469" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A case study using the HumanEval benchmark shows that an adaptive way of using multiple GPT models can achieve both much higher accuracy (from 68% to 90%) and lower inference cost (by 18%) than using GPT-4 for coding.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>GPT-4 is a big upgrade of foundation model capability, e.g., in code and math, accompanied by a much higher (more than 10x) price per token to use over GPT-3.5-Turbo. On a code completion benchmark, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai_humaneval" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HumanEval</a>, developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 can successfully solve 68% tasks while GPT-3.5-Turbo does 46%. It is possible to increase the success rate of GPT-4 further by generating multiple responses or making multiple calls. However, that will further increase the cost, which is already nearly 20 times of using GPT-3.5-Turbo and with more restricted API call rate limit. Can we achieve more with less?</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore a creative, adaptive way of using GPT models which leads to a big leap forward.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="observations">Observations<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/05/18/GPT-adaptive-humaneval#observations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Observations" title="Direct link to Observations">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>GPT-3.5-Turbo can already solve 40%-50% tasks. For these tasks if we never use GPT-4, we can save nearly 40-50% cost.</li>
<li>If we use the saved cost to generate more responses with GPT-4 for the remaining unsolved tasks, it is possible to solve some more of them while keeping the amortized cost down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The obstacle of leveraging these observations is that we do not know <em>a priori</em> which tasks can be solved by the cheaper model, which tasks can be solved by the expensive model, and which tasks can be solved by paying even more to the expensive model.</p>
<p>To overcome that obstacle, one may want to predict which task requires what model to solve and how many responses are required for each task. Let's look at one example code completion task:</p>

<p>Can we predict whether GPT-3.5-Turbo can solve this task or do we need to use GPT-4? My first guess is that GPT-3.5-Turbo can get it right because the instruction is fairly straightforward. Yet, it turns out that GPT-3.5-Turbo does not consistently get it right, if we only give it one chance. It's not obvious (but an interesting research question!) how to predict the performance without actually trying.</p>
<p>What else can we do? We notice that:
<strong>It's "easier" to verify a given solution than finding a correct solution from scratch.</strong></p>
<p>Some simple example test cases are provided in the docstr. If we already have a response generated by a model, we can use those test cases to filter wrong implementations, and either use a more powerful model or generate more responses, until the result passes the example test cases. Moreover, this step can be automated by asking GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate assertion statements from the examples given in the docstr (a simpler task where we can place our bet) and executing the code.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solution">Solution<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/05/18/GPT-adaptive-humaneval#solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solution" title="Direct link to Solution">​</a></h2>
<p>Combining these observations, we can design a solution with two intuitive ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make use of auto-generated feedback, i.e., code execution results, to filter responses.</li>
<li>Try inference configurations one by one, until one response can pass the filter.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Design" src="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/assets/images/design-88630f6d8d95f1e31ef5ce79e81aab54.png" width="2001" height="738" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This solution works adaptively without knowing or predicting which task fits which configuration. It simply tries multiple configurations one by one, starting from the cheapest configuration. Note that one configuration can generate multiple responses (by setting the inference parameter n larger than 1). And different configurations can use the same model and different inference parameters such as n and temperature. Only one response is returned and evaluated per task.</p>
<p>An implementation of this solution is provided in <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/code_utils#implement">autogen</a>. It uses the following sequence of configurations:</p>
<ol>
<li>GPT-3.5-Turbo, n=1, temperature=0</li>
<li>GPT-3.5-Turbo, n=7, temperature=1, stop=["\nclass", "\ndef", "\nif", "\nprint"]</li>
<li>GPT-4, n=1, temperature=0</li>
<li>GPT-4, n=2, temperature=1, stop=["\nclass", "\ndef", "\nif", "\nprint"]</li>
<li>GPT-4, n=1, temperature=1, stop=["\nclass", "\ndef", "\nif", "\nprint"]</li>
</ol>

<p>The first figure in this blog post shows the success rate and average inference cost of the adaptive solution compared with default GPT-4.
The inference cost includes the cost for generating the assertions in our solution. The generated assertions are not always correct, and programs that pass/fail the generated assertions are not always right/wrong. Despite of that, the adaptive solution can increase the success rate (referred to as pass@1 in the literature) from 68% to 90%, while reducing the cost by 18%.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of function definitions which are solved by different configurations in the portfolio.</p>

<p>The last problem is an example with wrong example test cases in the original definition. It misleads the adaptive solution because a correct implementation is regarded as wrong and more trials are made. The last configuration in the sequence returns the right implementation, even though it does not pass the auto-generated assertions. This example demonstrates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our adaptive solution has a certain degree of fault tolerance.</li>
<li>The success rate and inference cost for the adaptive solution can be further improved if correct example test cases are used.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that the reduced inference cost is the amortized cost over all the tasks. For each individual task, the cost can be either larger or smaller than directly using GPT-4. This is the nature of the adaptive solution: The cost is in general larger for difficult tasks than that for easy tasks.</p>
<p>An example notebook to run this experiment can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/v1.2.1/notebook/research/autogen_code.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/v1.2.1/notebook/research/autogen_code.ipynb</a>. The experiment was run when AutoGen was a subpackage in FLAML.</p>

<p>Our solution is quite simple to implement using a generic interface offered in <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#logic-error"><code>autogen</code></a>, yet the result is quite encouraging.</p>
<p>While the specific way of generating assertions is application-specific, the main ideas are general in LLM operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate multiple responses to select - especially useful when selecting a good response is relatively easier than generating a good response at one shot.</li>
<li>Consider multiple configurations to generate responses - especially useful when:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Model and other inference parameter choice affect the utility-cost tradeoff; or</li>
<li>Different configurations have complementary effect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/04/21/LLM-tuning-math">previous blog post</a> provides evidence that these ideas are relevant in solving math problems too.
<code>autogen</code> uses a technique <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EcoOptiGen</a> to support inference parameter tuning and model selection.</p>
<p>There are many directions of extensions in research and development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generalize the way to provide feedback.</li>
<li>Automate the process of optimizing the configurations.</li>
<li>Build adaptive agents for different applications.</li>
</ul>
