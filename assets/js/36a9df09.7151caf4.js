The TSLA current stock price is $199.95, with a decrease of 4.24% over the past month.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinancial_assistant (to User):\n\nTo complete this task, we need historical stock price data for NVDA and TSLA for the past month. However, as I cannot browse the web or fetch live data directly, let's simulate this by inferring the past month's data based on the provided information.\n\nWe have the current stock price and the percentage change for NVDA and TSLA over the past month. We can calculate the stock price one month ago by reversing the percentage change calculation. \n\nLet's also assume for the sake of this task that the stock prices changed linearly over the past month. In reality, stock prices fluctuate daily, so the graph would be more complex, but we can't recreate those fluctuations with just two data points. \n\nWe can use the `matplotlib` library in Python to plot this data. Please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Current prices and percentage changes\nNVDA_current_price = 726.13\nNVDA_change_pct = 21.72\nTSLA_current_price = 199.95\nTSLA_change_pct = -4.24\n\n# Calculate prices one month ago\nNVDA_price_month_ago = NVDA_current_price / (1 + NVDA_change_pct/100)\nTSLA_price_month_ago = TSLA_current_price / (1 - TSLA_change_pct/100)\n\n# Create arrays for plotting\ndates = np.array(['One month ago', 'Today'])\nNVDA_prices = np.array([NVDA_price_month_ago, NVDA_current_price])\nTSLA_prices = np.array([TSLA_price_month_ago, TSLA_current_price])\n\n# Plotting\nplt.plot(dates, NVDA_prices, label='NVDA')\nplt.plot(dates, TSLA_prices, label='TSLA')\nplt.legend()\nplt.ylabel('Stock price')\nplt.title('Stock prices over the past month')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis script plots the \"past\" and current stock prices for NVDA and TSLA. It creates a line graph with the date on the x-axis and the stock price on the y-axis. It also adds a title to the graph and a legend indicating which line corresponds to which stock.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser (to Financial_assistant):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: \nFigure(640x480)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinancial_assistant (to User):\n\nGreat! The code ran successfully. The `Figure(640x480)` statement denotes the size of the displayed figure, but it's not the actual graph. \n\nIn a typical interactive Python environment, the `plt.show()` function directly displays the plot. Since the execution environment here may not support interactive display of the graph, you're not seeing the graph as an output. \n\nYou'd usually see a line chart with two lines, one for NVDA and one for TSLA, indicating their price change from one month ago to today.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience caused by the visualization constraints of the current interaction mode. You can try running the exact same code in an interactive Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, and you would be able to see the graph.\n\nI hope you found my assistance helpful in understanding the logic and code to plot the stock prices of NVDA and TSLA.

Whether you're a seasoned investor or a curious newbie, understanding stock trends of top-performing companies like NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), Tesla Inc (TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT) can offer invaluable insights into the fast-paced world of finance. \n\nTraditionally, this type of analysis would require countless hours spent poring over dense financial documents, analyzing figures, and making educated guesses. Yet, with Python, the prospect of quickly reviewing stock performances isn't just possible\u2014it's incredibly accessible and surprisingly engaging.\n\n## Harnessing Python and Yahoo Finance Data\n\nIn the world where data reigns supreme, the clever use of Python code makes it a cinch to fetch current stock prices and calculate performance over a given period. The yfinance library proves invaluable here. It fetches data from Yahoo Finance, sparing you the hassle of data collection. \n\nWith just a Python script, you can instruct your computer to fetch and analyze the last month's performance for NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT in terms of percentage. This simplifies the process of understanding what\u2019s been happening with these dynamite stocks recently. \n\n## Unravel the Mystery Behind Stock Performance\n\nOf course, knowing a stock's performance is just the first step. Why does a particular stock perform the way it does? There\u2019s not always an easy answer, as stock performance can hinge on various factors. These mandators include company announcements, earnings reports, investor sentiment, market trends, and economic indicators.\n\nFor those of you hungry to know why NVDA, TSLA, or MSFT experienced a particular spike or dip, consider looking into any significant events, news, or announcements over the past month relating to that stock. Was there a breakthrough product announced? Perhaps a promising earnings report? Or maybe a broader market trend affected technology companies as a whole?\n\n## Dive Deeper with the NewsAPI\n\nOne way to stay afloat in the torrent of stock-related news is by using the NewsAPI in conjunction with the Python requests library. This combination assists in fetching and analyzing news related to the companies of your interest, keeping you abreast of events that might directly affect stock performance.\n\n## Visualize the Stock Prices with matplotlib\n\nVisualization is an absolute game-changer when it comes to understanding data, and yes, stock prices are no different whatsoever. Once you've fetched the stock prices using yfinance, you can use the Python libraries, pandas for data management and matplotlib for plotting. These tools allow you to graph the stocks' closing prices over the given period, providing a clear, visual summary of their performance. \n\nTo make the analysis even more concrete, the Python code stores the closing dates and prices of each stock in separate .csv files. This way, you always have a concrete log of the data breaking down the stock performances over time.\n\nAnd there you have it! Using Python, even the novice investors among us can dive headfirst into the sea of stock market analysis. As you get comfortable retrieving and analyzing stock data, you'll find the information you glean from this process invaluable, whether you're making personal investments or just following market trends out of interest.\n\nWelcome to the new era of stock analysis!

Whether you're a seasoned investor or a curious newbie, understanding stock trends of top-performing companies like NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), Tesla Inc (TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT) can offer invaluable insights into the fast-paced world of finance. \n\nTraditionally, this type of analysis would require countless hours spent poring over dense financial documents, analyzing figures, and making educated guesses. Yet, with Python, the prospect of quickly reviewing stock performances isn't just possible\u2014it's incredibly accessible and surprisingly engaging.\n\n## Harnessing Python and Yahoo Finance Data\n\nIn the world where data reigns supreme, the clever use of Python code makes it a cinch to fetch current stock prices and calculate performance over a given period. The yfinance library proves invaluable here. It fetches data from Yahoo Finance, sparing you the hassle of data collection. \n\nWith just a Python script, you can instruct your computer to fetch and analyze the last month's performance for NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT in terms of percentage. This simplifies the process of understanding what\u2019s been happening with these dynamite stocks recently. \n\n## Unravel the Mystery Behind Stock Performance\n\nOf course, knowing a stock's performance is just the first step. Why does a particular stock perform the way it does? There\u2019s not always an easy answer, as stock performance can hinge on various factors. These mandators include company announcements, earnings reports, investor sentiment, market trends, and economic indicators.\n\nFor those of you hungry to know why NVDA, TSLA, or MSFT experienced a particular spike or dip, consider looking into any significant events, news, or announcements over the past month relating to that stock. Was there a breakthrough product announced? Perhaps a promising earnings report? Or maybe a broader market trend affected technology companies as a whole?\n\n## Dive Deeper with the NewsAPI\n\nOne way to stay afloat in the torrent of stock-related news is by using the NewsAPI in conjunction with the Python requests library. This combination assists in fetching and analyzing news related to the companies of your interest, keeping you abreast of events that might directly affect stock performance.\n\n## Visualize the Stock Prices with matplotlib\n\nVisualization is an absolute game-changer when it comes to understanding data, and yes, stock prices are no different whatsoever. Once you've fetched the stock prices using yfinance, you can use the Python libraries, pandas for data management and matplotlib for plotting. These tools allow you to graph the stocks' closing prices over the given period, providing a clear, visual summary of their performance. \n\nTo make the analysis even more concrete, the Python code stores the closing dates and prices of each stock in separate .csv files. This way, you always have a concrete log of the data breaking down the stock performances over time.\n\nAnd there you have it! Using Python, even the novice investors among us can dive headfirst into the sea of stock market analysis. As you get comfortable retrieving and analyzing stock data, you'll find the information you glean from this process invaluable, whether you're making personal investments or just following market trends out of interest.\n\nWelcome to the new era of stock analysis!
